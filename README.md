# Motion-Denoising
This is the code for the Motion Denoising project, for the course *Introduction to Deep Learning* for both CentraleSup√©lec & MVA. \
The notebook can be directly launched in colab and presents the results discussed in the article ![here](DLI___report.pdf).

## To-do :
- [X] Rendering utilities.
- [X] Data processing utilities.
- [X] Basic VAE model.
- [X] Projection paths analysis.
- [X] Denoising by gradient descent.
- [X] Denoising by Interpolation.
- [X] Decoder block into denoising Autoencoder.
- [X] Gradient descent in sinusoidal basis. 
- [X] Denoiser model with sinsuoidal basis.
